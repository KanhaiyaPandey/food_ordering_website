# react01

my first time using React.js.

Injecting React through CDN.

Created a simple React element by React.createElement("example").

A React element is nothing but a JavaScript object.

Created a root and assigning the root.

Used root.render method the add the element inside the root.

Root is the only place where we can apply react its only apply once and we can use root.render only once.

Created nested element i.e. Heading, Heading2 by React and added them to the root.

And I am excited to learn more.........................



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// on second session ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


installed npm, React, ReactDOM, Parcel for minifications and Optimization.
Learned about how parcel do all the crazy stuffs in just few seconds and why bundlers are so important because React is fast because of the help of these bundlers.
Ignited my app. Do npx parcel <//entry point//>.
The parcel is not alone for these crazy  stuffs there are many thing behind he scene and they have there own dependencies to something. This thing called Transitive Dependency.

Added gpg verification.git 


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////// on third session ////////////////////////////////

//////////////Routers///////////////

React-Router-Dom is the package to download react router.

learned about routing.

to config routs we need a function named createBrowserRouter there many other routers too but the is the most recommonded one.

Linkend component and tags with Link tag its a tag come from react router dom package.

children routs should be render inside outlet.

<!-- class base component -->
 --> 9th lesson

 class base component is the old way react used upon.

 In CBC we declaire state variable inside constructor method and when the component render the constructor call first before the render.

 We define every state veriable inside that constructor. Its looks more convinent then functional component but it's get messy and complex when we set state.

 learned about mounting updating and unmounting, and lifecycle of react app.

 <!-- optimising -->

 builded my own hooks and cleaning the app.
