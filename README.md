# react01

my first time using React.js.

Injecting React through CDN.

Created a simple React element by React.createElement("example").

A React element is nothing but a JavaScript object.

Created a root and assigning the root.

Used root.render method the add the element inside the root.

Root is the only place where we can apply react its only apply once and we can use root.render only once.

Created nested element i.e. Heading, Heading2 by React and added them to the root.

And I am excited to learn more.........................

installed npm, React, ReactDOM, Parcel for minifications and Optimization.
Learned about how parcel do all the crazy stuffs in just few seconds and why bundlers are so important because React is fast because of the help of these bundlers.
Ignited my app. Do npx parcel <entry point>.
The parcel is not alone for these crazy  stuffs there are many thing behind he scene and they have there own dependencies to something. This thing called Transitive Dependency.
