# react01

my first time using React.js.

Injecting React through CDN.

Created a simple React element by React.createElement("example").

A React element is nothing but a JavaScript object.

Created a root and assigning the root.

Used root.render method the add the element inside the root.

Root is the only place where we can apply react its only apply once and we can use root.render only once.

Created nested element i.e. Heading, Heading2 by React and added them to the root.

And I am excited to learn more.........................
